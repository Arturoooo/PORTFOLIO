## About Me 
My name is Artur Oszczepali≈Ñski and I am currently working as a junior manual tester. In the future, I would like to become an automation tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. My international experience has also equipped me with valuable tools, such as open-mindedness and adaptability. In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in automation testing.
**My Experience 
I started my first serious job in a company of about 500 people. I was mainly responsible for customer service for the online store. However, I have always been interested in IT and I wanted to improve myself in this direction, so I tried and managed to get a job as a junior manual tester. In my current job I am testing banking applications for the German Commerzbank. We use the OCTANE program to report tests.
